#summary How to install the Eclipse Plug-in
#labels Featured,Cookbook

easyb now has an Eclipse plugin -- this is a work in progress, however, early versions support running easyb stories and specifications and support an Outline view of behaviors. By right clicking on a .story file (or .specification) you can select the *Run As* item, and then you'll see a handy option to run as an easyb story. 

Installing the plug-in works as follows:
  # Go to the *Help* menu and then select *Software Updates...*
  # Hit the *Add Site..* button and in the resulting dialog, for the location type: {{{http://easyb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-plugins/org.easyb.eclipse.updatesite/}}}
  # Hit the *Ok* button
  # Select the easyb Eclipse Update Site in the list box and then hit the *Install...* button

That's it!
